# Elevator_Pitch

Hello, my name is Hubert. I've finished a business degree and have been programming as a hobby for over 6 years. I've learned the ins and outs of the business operations process during my university study. I've also been a part of a successful open-source gaming framework team which is now used by over 90% of servers on an engine called FiveM. As part of a small development team, we took care of the entire process of development, management, testing and release. Our aproach was very agile and releases were weekly, this allowed us to focus on our goals, reduce wasted time and ensure that the product meets our community's needs. Through extensive research I've discovered that this is called DevOps. Combining Development and operations into one area. Ever since, I've continued to learn and improve my skills to persue my programming passion and start a career in this emerging area of computing.

## To improve

- Role and benefits to company/project
- What I did and what I enjoyed about what I've done
- More passion when discussing the successes
