# Elevator_Pitch

Hello, my name is Hubert. I've finished a business degree and have been programming as a hobby for over 6 years. I've learned the ins and outs of the business operations process during my university study, during which we've learned about agile and lean concepts. I've also been a co-owner of a successful open-source gaming framework team which is now used by over 90% of servers on an engine called FiveM. As part of a small development team, we took care of the entire process of development, management, testing and release and my main role was to manage the team tasks, ensure that every member knows what they doing but also test and develop main features. I've applied the concepts learned at my university leading to a very agile environment that consisted of weekly releases and constant testing. This allowed us to focus on our goals, reduce wasted time and ensure that the releases meets our community's needs. I loved being able to meet the team daily, with like-minded people and share ideas and developments we've all done, all working together for the overall project. Through research I've discovered that this is called DevOps which combines development and operations into one area. We've eventually slowed down the development and since then, I've continued to learn and improve my skills to persue my programming passion and start a career in this emerging area of DevOps.
